//Algorithms   steps in process that we take to perform a desired action with computers
/*Algorithms  allow us to use language build in data structures like arrays and objects or prrmitives such
as integers and booleans and even customer data types like we did when we used the class keyword create
stacks queues binary search trees
*/

/*Recursion is when you define something in terms of itself , simply, its a function that refers to itself
inside of the functions
is really good for task that repeattly  subtask to do

searching Dom tree,
and javascript objects


Recursion and stackOverflow
compputer need allocated memory to  remember things stackoeverflow can occur when we have recursion and there is no way to  stop this recursive call
it simply the computer say whoa whoa whoa, this is getting silly I am not remember anymore things.
recursion can happens
Maxinum call stack size exeeded

identify base case();
identify  the recursive case

/* every time you are using a tree or converting  something into a tree, consider recursion.

1. Devided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instance of the same problem.
2. Each instance of the subproblem is identical in  nature.
3. The solution of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand.
